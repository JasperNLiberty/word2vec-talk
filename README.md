Word2vec Algorithm: Made as simple as possible, but no simpler
====

----
Summary
----

This talk will give a Pythonic introduction to the word2vec algorithm. Word2vec, translating words (strings) to vectors (lists of floats), is a relatively new algorithm which has proved to be very useful for making sense of text data. You will gain a conceptual understanding of the algorithm and be empowered to try it out on your favorite collection of text data.

Description
----

“You shall know a word by the company it keeps” is a common refrain in natural language processing (NLP). word2vec is a simple neural network that learns which words tend to co-occur and embeds the words in a vector space. From these word embeddings, it is possible to use distance measures to compare words, find neighbors by clustering, and add/subtract words to explore relationships between concepts. Actually, word2vec is a general purpose algorithm that allows any sequential data to be encoded into meaningful vectors - including emojis!
